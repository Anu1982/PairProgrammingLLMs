# PairProgrammingLLMs
My code on pair programming with Github Copilot, the pair programming notebooks are based on Deeplearning.AI course on Large Language Models. The course follows Google's PaLM API, however, this code primarily uses Github Copilot for same exercises through Github Copilot, Chat extensions in Visual Studio Code.

Not all exercises are run in Jupyter notebooks some are executed in the chat window and then imported to the Jupyter notebooks
